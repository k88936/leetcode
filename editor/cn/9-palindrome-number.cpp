/**
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise. 

 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 1
21-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

 Example 3: 

 
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 -2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1 
 

 
Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
